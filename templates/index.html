        <p>Protecting your brand and intellectual property is essential for long-term business success. One critical
          step in this process is conducting a thorough trademark class search. Trademarks are valuable business assets
          that provide legal protection and grant exclusive rights over your brand name, logo, or slogan. Understanding
          trademark classifications and conducting a proper trademark category analysis are key to successful trademark
          registration and enforcement.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h3>What is a Trademark?</h3>
          <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-fill icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>A trademark is a unique word, name, symbol, logo, or slogan that identifies and distinguishes the goods or
            services of one party from those of others in the market. Trademarks play a vital role in brand recognition
            and customer trust. When registered, a trademark offers legal protection against unauthorized use, allowing
            the owner to prevent others from exploiting the mark without consent. Trademarks can consist of words,
            phrases, symbols, designs, or a combination of these elements.

        <div class="question">
          <h3>What is a Trademark Class?</h3>
          <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-fill icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Trademarks are classified into various categories known as trademark classes, based on the nature of the
            goods or services they represent. This classification system, called the Nice Classification, was
            established by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It divides goods and services into 45
            distinct classes â€” 34 for goods and 11 for services. Properly identifying and assigning your trademark to
            the correct class is essential for ensuring comprehensive legal protection and avoiding conflicts during the
            registration process.

          <h3>Trademark Class List</h3>
          <i class="ri-arrow-down-s-fill icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The trademark class list provides a structured framework for categorizing a broad range of goods and
            services. This system is designed to simplify the trademark registration process and ensure clarity in
            intellectual property rights. For businesses seeking to protect their brand, it is crucial to understand the
            specifics of this classification system. Accurate classification helps ensure that trademarks are registered
            appropriately and are well-protected against potential infringement.
